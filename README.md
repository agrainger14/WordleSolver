# WordleSolver
The Wordle Solver is a basic program developed with vanilla Java to play the Wordle game, it loads a list of valid 5 letter words used in the game from a CSV file and attempts to guess the target word based on thhe user input to the console.

## How It Works

On run, the words are loaded and the first word attempt is provided to the user.
The user then inputs into a console a valid response (String with 5 valid chars either (g, y or e)
### G = valid word letter in the correct position
### Y = valid word letter in the incorrect position
### E = not a valid word letter
